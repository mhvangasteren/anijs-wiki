We are very pleased to announce the [AniJS library](http://anijs.github.io/) latest release: version 0.8.0

The new main powerful features are:

- [CSS selectors with steroids](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Selecting-html-elements).
- [Add, remove and toggle classes](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Playing-with-CSS-classes).
- [Remove and clone html elements](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Clone-and-remove).

Now, using the standard [AniJS](http://anijs.github.io/) syntax (if,on,do,to) the people can make not only animations, with the new version we want to reinforce a underlying and nevertheless essential concept: **INTERACTIVITY**. 

[AniJS Library](http://anijs.github.io/) is not attempting to replace amazing libraries like JQuery, but rather is building a bridge between web and interaction designers, programmers, and creative people in general. By giving a plain English tool, AniJS is helping to reach new interactivity levels in an effortless way. The new version strengthens this idea.

The library leaves the door opens also to javascript developers, by providing them with productive interfaces called [helpers](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Clone-and-remove) for extending the library and encouraging them to introduce their own enhancements to the already established concepts and tools.

A lot of new examples was added, [notification app](http://codepen.io/darielnoel/full/EdueI/), [accordion](http://codepen.io/darielnoel/full/qvGEb/), [tabbar](http://codepen.io/darielnoel/full/uJLGb/), [modal](http://codepen.io/darielnoel/full/vpBhy/), and [others](http://anijs.github.io/#intro). 

We have special interest to share this announcement with the community.
